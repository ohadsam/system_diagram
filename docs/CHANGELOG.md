# Changelog

All notable changes to this project. Format: date, then bullet list.
Keep this in sync with `PLAN.md` as stages complete.

## Unreleased

- Initial build: full client-side system design diagram builder per
  `SPEC.md` v1 — canvas, ~310-component library across 19 categories,
  connectors with configurable routing/arrowheads, style toolbar, details
  panel with sub-components/rows, custom component & shape builder,
  localStorage autosave + named projects, JSON/PNG/PDF export, dismissible
  hints, responsive/mobile layout, standalone `help.html` guide, unit +
  Playwright e2e tests (44 + 24 passing), GitHub Pages deploy workflow.
- Fixed during review: clicking a node during a drag gesture suppressed
  the browser's default focus-shift (a `preventDefault()` side effect),
  which silently broke keyboard shortcuts (Delete/undo/duplicate) right
  after interacting with the canvas — now explicitly focuses the
  node/edge/canvas so shortcuts always work.
  Fixed: components saved to "My Components" couldn't actually be placed
  on the canvas (their ids weren't resolved against the custom-component
  registry, only the built-in library) — a core feature that was
  silently broken.
  Fixed: the contextual toolbar row's `hidden` attribute had no visual
  effect because `.toolbar-row` also sets `display: flex`, which (per the
  CSS cascade) silently wins over the browser's `[hidden] { display:none }`
  default — added an explicit override rule.
  Added: Ctrl/Cmd+S now saves an actual checkpoint (was previously a no-op
  beyond swallowing the browser's Save Page dialog while typing).
  Added: the mobile sidebar drawer now auto-closes after a component is
  placed or the canvas is tapped, instead of requiring an extra tap.

## Unreleased (2)

- Added **Layers & Roles** category (~97 items: Controller, Service, DAL,
  Authentication, React Hook, Angular Guard, DDD building blocks, ...).
  Drag one onto an existing node to attach it as a sub-component (green
  dashed drop highlight); drop/click on empty canvas places it as a
  normal standalone node. The details panel's sub-component name field
  now autocompletes against this library and auto-fills the icon.
- Added **Design Patterns** category (24 blueprints: MVC, MVVM, Layered
  Architecture, Repository, CQRS, API Gateway, Circuit Breaker,
  Publish-Subscribe, Event Sourcing, Saga, Sidecar, Strangler Fig, BFF,
  Hexagonal Architecture, Service Discovery, Cache-Aside, Rate Limiting,
  plus classic GoF patterns Singleton/Factory Method/Observer/Strategy/
  Adapter/Decorator). Dropping or clicking one instantiates the whole
  cluster of nodes + connectors at once, positioned around the drop
  point, selected together as a single undo step.
- Library now totals ~430 components across 21 categories.

## Unreleased (3)

- Added **AI Providers & Agents** category (~57 items): model providers
  (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Mistral, Cohere,
  Hugging Face, Ollama, Groq, ...), specific model families (GPT, Claude,
  Gemini, Llama, Whisper, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, ...), the Model
  Context Protocol (MCP Server/Client/Tool/Resource/Prompt), agents and
  agent frameworks (LangGraph, AutoGen, CrewAI, Semantic Kernel,
  LlamaIndex, agent memory/planner/orchestrator), and the skills/tools/RAG
  building blocks around them (Skill, Skill Library, System Prompt, Prompt
  Template, RAG Pipeline, Knowledge Base, Guardrails, Fine-Tuning Job,
  Function/Tool Calling). A plain component category — no special
  attach/instantiate behavior, complements the existing AI/ML (ML infra)
  category rather than duplicating it.
- Library now totals ~490 components across 22 categories.
